Contributing to Onlineweb4
==========================

Before submitting a new issue or opening a new PR, please search to see if the same issue/PR already exists. 

Anyone are free to contribute to the Onlineweb4 repository. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute 
changes that get things working in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow 
to keep track of everything.

Write informative commits and pull requests
-------------------------------------------

This is important for us to understand what you would like to change or fix. Commit messages should follow the form explained 
[here](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message).

The pull requests should be as detailed as possible.

Follow the PEP8 standard
------------------------

If you do changes to the Python code base, please follow the PEP8 standard as described 
[here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

Label issues appropriately
--------------------------

When issues are properly labelled, it is easier for us to prioritize which issues to handle at a glance. 
Ideally, an issue is marked with what package it belongs to, the priority, its status, and the type of issue it is.
Additionally, if an issue seems like an easy fix, please label it as such.

Make sure all tests are successful
----------------------------------

We use TeamCity to run the test suite and build the project for every new pull request. Make sure all tests are
successful for you pull request. We will not merge any branches that breaks the build. You can see the tests 
[here](https://online.ntnu.no/tc/).

Other notices
=============

Note that dotkom and Online reserves the right to reject any issue or pull request without having to give an explanation.
